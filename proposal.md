# The Edge of the World

## Description
Going to be a single "room" of sorts to show off NPC dialogue. Will include exploring an environment, sprite animations, and NPC interactibility. Relevant as it will be a form of art in that it will be an early concept of a game that could be fleshed out into an actual full on game

## Features
- Interactable/Scrollable Environment
	- Will make sure the "player" character isn't able to go through things like rocks, possibly houses, etc. and scrolls with the player
- Player Animations/Walk Cycle/Exploring their environment
	- Will use WASD to control movement, will figure out how to change the image being blitted based on the button being pressed
- NPC Dialogue
	- Will make it so that you can press E to interact with NPC's and see what they have to say, not interactable dialogue

## Challenges
- Need to learn how to make the "camera"/screen follow the player
- Need to learn how to make a scrollable environment
- Need to learn how to make an NPC dialogue popup and talk to them

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is for it to be a full environment, background music, interactable characters, obstacles that can't be walked through, and a player character that the camera follows, and has animations for turning

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Minimal outcome is an environment that doesn't scroll so that the game would have to be in a single screen, no obstacles, still need NPC dialogue, still need background music, player character should have walking animations

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Make a player character with walking animations and a following camera
  2. Make the environment to place them in with background music, and try to find out how to make it scroll

- Week 2
  1. Create NPC sprites and make them interactable
  2. Create the dialogue popup

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Make the environment have obstacles
  2. Possibly add more NPC's using same NPC interactibility from week 2
