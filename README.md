## Description
A tiny piece of the world in a void near a sea of stars. Has NPC's you can interact with and an environment to explore

## Features
- Camera follows player around the world
- Player has a walk cycle
- NPC's have dialogue (Tomato specifically has dialogue she wanted in the game)
- Has music that changes when interacting with 2 NPC's
- Can speak with NPC's and go through their dialogues, with one last dialogue option that repeats
- Player can't walk through "obstactles" such as the houses, edge of the world, railing, off the bridge, or the npc's themselves
- When talking to some NPC's again their dialogue or/and model changes, as well as the music

## Files
- Audio folder has files for the music of the project, all music was created or remade by my friend Tomato
- Images folder has files for the art for the game (Dialogue box/prompt/button, furret pictures for him to animate, markiplier picture, pictures for the player for the walk cycle, pictures for the tomato transformation, and pictures for the environment), all created by me, except for the "deity.png" picture
- The project.py file is obviously all the code to make the project work

## Future Areas of Improvement
I could probably make future projects more optimized so there isn't as much code
